1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This disclosure relates to digital public procurement systems, specifically to automated calculation, payment, verification, and auditing of statutory procurement-related administrative and agreement fees payable to a government treasury.

The disclosure further relates to government digital revenue assurance systems, e-procurement platforms, and integrated financial management systems.

2. BACKGROUND

In public sector procurement, contractors are typically required to pay statutory fees calculated as fixed percentages of approved contract values. These fees often include administrative charges, agreement execution fees, or similar levies defined by regulation or law.

Historically, such fees have been:

Calculated manually or semi-manually

Paid through fragmented channels

Poorly audited

Susceptible to under-collection, forgery of receipts, and revenue leakage

There exists a need for a fully automated, transparent, auditable, and treasury-integrated system that ensures correct computation, payment, verification, and oversight of such statutory procurement fees.

3. SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE

Disclosed is a computer-implemented system and method that:

Accepts a government-approved contract value as input

Automatically calculates:

A fixed administrative fee (e.g., 0.25%)

A fixed agreement fee (e.g., 0.50%)

Converts all monetary values into numeric and textual (words) representations

Integrates directly with a government treasury or payment gateway

Generates digitally verifiable receipts

Assigns unique transaction reference numbers

Maintains an immutable audit trail

Provides QR-code based public verification

Embeds seamlessly into a government digital enterprise or e-procurement platform

Enforces fee compliance as a precondition for contract execution

4. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

The disclosed system comprises the following logical components:

4.1 User Interface Layer

Contractor-facing web interface

Government MDA dashboard

Oversight authority interface

4.2 Application Services Layer

Fee Calculation Engine

Amount-to-Words Conversion Module

Receipt and Document Generator

QR Code Verification Service

Reference Number Generator

4.3 Integration Layer

Government Single Sign-On (SSO)

Treasury / Pay Direct payment systems

E-Procurement platforms

4.4 Data & Audit Layer

Transaction database

Immutable audit logs

Reporting and analytics store

5. FEE CALCULATION METHOD

The system calculates statutory fees using fixed percentage multipliers applied to the approved contract value.

Example implementation:

Administrative Fee = Contract Value × 0.0025

Agreement Fee = Contract Value × 0.005

Total Payable = Sum of all applicable fees

These calculations are performed automatically upon data entry and require no manual intervention.

6. AMOUNT-TO-WORDS CONVERSION

All monetary values generated by the system are programmatically converted into formal textual representations, suitable for legal, audit, and contractual purposes (e.g., “One Hundred Million Naira Only”).

This conversion applies to:

Contract value

Individual fees

Total payable amount

7. PAYMENT AND TREASURY INTEGRATION

Upon calculation, the system initiates payment via a government treasury or centralized payment gateway, ensuring:

Direct remittance to government accounts

Elimination of cash handling

Real-time payment confirmation

Payment confirmation automatically triggers:

Receipt generation

Audit log finalization

Compliance status update

8. RECEIPT GENERATION AND VERIFICATION

The system generates digitally signed receipts containing:

Government branding

Fee breakdown

Unique transaction reference

Date and time

Embedded QR code

The QR code resolves to a public verification endpoint confirming the authenticity and payment status of the transaction.

9. AUDIT TRAIL AND GOVERNANCE

Every transaction records:

User identity

Timestamp

Entered values

Calculated fees

Payment status

Treasury confirmation reference

Audit logs are designed to be immutable and accessible to authorized oversight bodies, including auditors and anti-corruption agencies.

10. PLATFORM EMBEDDING AND INTEROPERABILITY

The system is designed to be:

Embedded as a module within a government digital enterprise platform

Integrated with existing e-procurement workflows

Accessible through role-based permissions

The system may be implemented using web technologies such as React, Angular, or equivalent frameworks, without limitation to any specific programming language.

11. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY

The disclosed system is applicable to:

State governments

National governments

Municipal procurement agencies

Public enterprises

Any entity collecting statutory procurement-related fees

12. PURPOSE OF DISCLOSURE

This publication is made to:

Establish public prior art

Prevent exclusive patent claims on the disclosed methods and systems

Preserve freedom to operate for Federal & State Governments and other public or private institutions

Encourage transparent, open, and auditable public procurement processes
